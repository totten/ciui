  <em>Scheduled Test</em> is a simple form of <em>continuous integration</em>.
  In this use-case, we will
  configure a job which runs every few hours and executes a test-suite with the
  latest version of our application. This can summarized with a little pseudo-code:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript" prettyprint-code="scheduledTestPseudocode()">
  </pre>

<p>
  The first two steps of the pseudo-code produce a complete, installed
  application (including various modules, add-ons, config files, and databases). We
  use this approach for a few basic reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>All</em> of CiviCRM's test suites are compatible with this approach.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Some</em> of CiviCRM's test suites (such as "WebTests") <em>require</em> this approach.
  </li>
  <li>
    Automating <code>downloadApplication()</code> and <code>installApplication()</code>
    is useful for multiple purposes (including continuous-testing; reproducing test failures;
    creating demo and training sites; and setting up local development sites).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To implement <em>Scheduled Test</em>, we will obtain and configure two tools -- Jenkins
  and Buildkit.

tests execute every few hours. This doesnâ€™t require much configuration, and it
runs the full test-suite. However, it
only tests code that has already been approved and merged into the official codebase.
Once a change has been merged,
developers must be responsive to regressions (e.g. identifying which change caused the
regression; reverting it;
writing another patch).


useful for continuous-integration. For example,
you might configure a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> job to
periodically download CiviCRM and execute the test-suite.
