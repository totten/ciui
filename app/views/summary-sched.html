<p>
  <em>Scheduled Test (with Jenkins)</em> is a simple form of <em>continuous integration</em>.
  In this use-case, we will
  configure a job which runs every few hours and executes a test-suite with the
  latest version of our application. This can be summarized with a little pseudo-code:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript" prettyprint-code="scheduledTestPseudocode()"></pre>

<p>
  The first few steps of the pseudo-code produce a clean, complete, installed
  application (including various modules, add-ons, config files, and databases). This
  adds some overhead to <code>scheduledTest()</code>, but we never-the-less have good
  reason to do a full installation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>All</em> of CiviCRM's test suites are <em>compatible</em> with a full installation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Some</em> of CiviCRM's test suites (such as "WebTests") <em>require</em> a full installation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To implement <em>Scheduled Test</em>, we will obtain and configure two tools -- Jenkins
  and Buildkit.

tests execute every few hours. This doesnâ€™t require much configuration, and it
runs the full test-suite. However, it
only tests code that has already been approved and merged into the official codebase.
Once a change has been merged,
developers must be responsive to regressions (e.g. identifying which change caused the
regression; reverting it;
writing another patch).


useful for continuous-integration. For example,
you might configure a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> job to
periodically download CiviCRM and execute the test-suite.
