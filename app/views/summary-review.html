  <em>Code Review Test</em> is useful for continuous-integration. For example,
  if a developer submits changes for code-review (e.g. by opening
  a pull-request on <code>github.com</code>), then
  <code>github.com</code> might notify your <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>
  server. Jenkins will then download CiviCRM (with patches),
  execute the test suite, and post the results on <code>github.com</code>.
