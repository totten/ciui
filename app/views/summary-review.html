  <em>Code Review Test</em> is another variation on <em>continuous integration</em>
  which makes sense when your project requires review of any code changes. This
  scenario involves a sequence of steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    A developer prepares a change to the codebase (eg to the civicrm-core code
    or to one of your own extensions/modules/themes).
  </li>
  <li>
    The developer submits the change for code-review by opening a
    pull-request on <code>github.com</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>github.com</code> notifies your <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> server
    of a pending change.
  </li>
  <li>
    Jenkins downloads the application (and the proposed change), executes the tests,
    and posts the results back to <code>github.com</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The original developer (or any other developers) can see the test results
    on <code>github.com</code> and make a decision about whether to merge the results.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  We will focus on automating the work done by Jenkins -- which can be summarized with some pseudo-code:
</p>

  This closely resembles the <code>scheduledTest()</code> pseudo-code from <em>Scheduled Test</em>.
  As before, it produces a complete, installed application (including various modules, add-ons,
  config files, and databases). However, it requires on additional step: the
  <code>applyPatch()</code> step fetches the proposed changes from code-review system (such as
  <code>github.com</code>) and applies them to the build.
